how do we do this?

receive begin time step message from parent

# simultaneous motion
for each drop
    move it
   if new new location is out of bounds
       send to parent.
       delete drop

#import/export drops
after all drops have moved
    send ok to parent
    receive from parent
        either ok or a drop
        if drop
            add to location list and receive again
        if ok move on

# process drop physics
if two drops are at the same location, test for coalescence
    if they coalesce
        combine them
    otherwise
        leave them 'on top of each other'

flush()  (should not be necessary)
send done to parent
End of Time Step


don't do this yet
#if a drop is too big
    #stochastically split it into two which are now 'on top of each other'
