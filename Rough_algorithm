how do we do this?

spawn node
MAYBE populate node stochastically
MAYBE send drops to node

node waits for messages

tell node to simulate a timestep

LOOP BEGIN
receive msg

# simultaneous motion
if msg is move
    for each drop
        move it
    # process drop physics
    if two drops are at the same location, test for coalescence
        if they coalesce
            combine them
        otherwise
            leave them 'on top of each other' as a list
    separate drops that local and those that are now out of bounds
        send out of bounds drops to parent
        delete out of bounds drops
    send ok to parent
    loop

#import/export drops
if msg is newdrop
    add to drop list
    loop

LOOP END


don't do this yet
if a drop is too big
    stochastically split it into two which are now 'on top of each other'
